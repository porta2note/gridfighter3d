# Gridfighter 3D

a virtual reality arcade experience

This is the official source code for Gridfighter 3D. This source should compile under Microsoft Quickbasic 4.5 for DOS, or any recent version of QB64 for Linux/OS/X/Windows (untested). No additional libraries are needed. Yes, this entire game is written in BASIC, and it's *full* of GOTOs. Deal with it. :P

NOTE: two versions of the source are provided, one for DOS using QB4.5 and the other for modern platforms using QB64. These differ only in a few functions (related to game timing, vsync, and file I/O) which need to be commented out or uncommented depending on which platform you're compiling for. Search the source for "UNCOMMENT" in order to find these.

This source code is licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL) v3. Looking up the text of this license is left as a homework exercise for the reader.

Contributions are welcome, if any of you want to waste your time improving this silly thing.

## Binaries
